## Overview

Provides Empiria Land services for large users like notaries, judges and other government entities and authorities. Services include deeds recording requests, preventive notes registration, certified copies, real estate certificates emission, and documents and images search services as well.

## Quick start

This project is being built with Angular 9 and TypeScript 3.7.

Then install **[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** (globally if possible), ensuring that you have installed **version 8.2** or higher.

```bash
# install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli

# check Angular CLI, Angular and TypeScript versions
ng --version
```

# change directory
cd Empiria.Land.OnlineServices

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# Use Angular CLI to start the server
