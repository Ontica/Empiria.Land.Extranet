## Overview

Provides Empiria Land services for large users like notaries, judges and other government entities and authorities. Services include recording requests of legal instruments, preventive notes registration, certified copies, real estate certificates emission, and documents and images search services as well.

## Quick start

This project is being built with Angular 10 and TypeScript 4.

Then install **[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** (globally if possible), ensuring that you have installed **version 10.1** or higher.

```bash
# install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli

# check Angular CLI, Angular and TypeScript versions
ng --version
```
